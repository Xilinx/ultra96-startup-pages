<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="well">
  <p>The matrix multiplication application example provides a complex test that generates two matrices on the Linux Cortex-A53 master. These matrices are then sent to the Cortex-R5 remote, which is used to multiply the matrices. The remote then sends the result back to the master, which display the result.</p>
  <p>The Linux master boots the bare-metal remote firmware using <b>remoteproc</b>. It then trasmits two randomly-generated matrices using RPMsg.</p>
  <p>The bare-metal firmware multiplies the two matrices and transmits the result back to the master using RPMsg.<p>
  <p>More information can be found in the latest <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2019_2/ug1186-zynq-openamp-gsg.pdf">UG1186</a> documentation (an internet connection is required to view this page).</p>
