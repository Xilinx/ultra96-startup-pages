        <h2>What is "dnf"?</h2>
        <div class="well">
	<p> DNF is a software package manager that installs, updates, and removes packages on RPM-based Linux distribution. For all of the detailed commands one can simply enter "dnf --help" into the terminal.</p>
	<p>If you want to simply update the packages to the latest, you may do so using dnf on the <a href="dnf_update.html">dnf Package Update</a> page.</p>
	<p>Below will be a number of sections explaining how to: search for packages, update packages, add/remove packages, and an example of using packages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Search for Packages</h2>
	<div class="well">
	  <p>The following command will show a list of all of the packages. There are a lot of packages so it is recommended to pipe this command into a file. You can also add an optional command afterwards of the package_name to narrow down the results.
	    <code>dnf repoquery &lt;package_name&gt;</code></p>
	</div>
 
        <h2>Update/Install Packages</h2>
	<div class="well">
	  <p>To update the packages and install a specific one follow the following commands:</p>
	  <code>dnf repoquery</code>
	  <code>dnf install -y &lt;package_name&gt;</code>
	  <p>Alternatively you can accomplish this on the webapp by going to the <a href="dnf_update.html">dnf Update</a> page and selecting what packages you wish to update.</p>
	</div>

        <h2>Use Case Example</h2>
	<div class="well">
	  <p>We will show an example of how to update, install, and then use one of the packages that we install. This example specifically will enable us to play the game OpenTyrian.</p>
	  <code>dnf repoquery</code>
	  <code>dnf install opentyrian</code>
	  <code>opentyrian</code>
	  <p>Now you will be able to play the game (only shows up on the desktop).</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Add/Remove Packages</h2>
	<div class="well">
        <p>In this section we will explain how to write a simple "Hello World" application, compile it, and create a RPM package with CMake, install/remove it with "dnf", and run it. This will demonstrate the ease of installing and removing packages with "dnf".
	  <ul><br>
	    <li>Create a hello directory where you think is applicable. A recommendation could be /home/&lt;username&gt;/Desktop/hello.</li><br>
	    <li>Install the rpm-build package using "dnf". CMake will use it to build the RPM package:<br>
              <code>dnf install rpm-build</code>
	    </li><br>
	    <li>Write the "Hello World" application in hello.c in your created hello directory:<br>
              <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>
		    int main(int argc, char *argv[])<br>
	 	    {<br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;printf("hello world\n");<br><br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br>
		    }
	      </code>
	    </li><br>
	    <li>Write the CMakeLists.txt file in the same directory. This is like a Makefile but is used by CMake. The following CMakeLists.txt file is very minimalistic(but works):<br>
	      <code>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)<br><br>
		    PROJECT(HelloWorld)<br><br>
	            ADD_EXECUTABLE(hello hello.c)<br>
		    INSTALL(TARGETS hello DESTINATION /usr/bin)<br><br>
		    SET(CPACK_GENERATOR "RPM")<br><br>
              	    INCLUDE(CPack)
              </code>
	    </li><br>
	    <li>Build the application and the RPM package. Install the RPM package with "dnf". Run the application. Remove the RPM package with "dnf".<br>
              <code># Build<br>
		    mkdir build<br>
		    cd build<br>
		    cmake ..<br>
		    make package<br><br>
		    # Install package<br>
		    dnf install HelloWorld-0.1.1-Linux.rpm<br><br>
		    # Run<br>
		    hello<br><br>
		    # Remove package<br>
		    dnf remove helloworld
	      </code>
	    </li><br> 
	    <li>Congratulations, if everything worked you would have seen the "Hello World" printed and would have successfully learned how to use "dnf" (along with some CMake).</li>
	</p>
