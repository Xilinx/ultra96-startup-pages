<h2>About</h2>
<div class="well">
	<p>Grove is a system for wiring up sensor and control modules using standardized connectors and cables. It makes it easy to hook up any of the 100s of available Grove modules to a microprocessor system without a messy tangle of wires. Each module provides a single function, such as sensing temperature or driving an LCD.</p>
	<p>All kit parts have their name at the bottom of each part.</p>
</div>
<h2>Included in this Kit</h2>
<div class="well">
    <ul class="features" style="list-style-position:inside">
        <li><b>96Boards Sensors Mezzanine</b></li>
        <p>This is the adapter for connecting Grove modules to a 96Boards baseboard. It provides 18 Grove connectors, an Arduino compatible shield socket, and an ATMEGA328P microcontroller.</p>

        <li><b>Grove Button Module (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>This Grove module is a simple momentary on/off button. When pressed, it pulls the data line up to VCC to output a HIGH signal. When released, the data line drops down to output LOW.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Button_Module.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Touch Sensor Module (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>A simple touch sensor that behaves in a similar fashion to the button. Outputs high when touching the sensor with finger, and low otherwise.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Touch_Sensor_Module.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove LED Socket Module (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>An LED in Grove module form. Plug your favourite colour of LED into the socket, and it will glow brightly when the signal line is driven HIGH. Long part of the LED goes into the "+" and the short side goes into the "-".</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_LED_Socket_Module.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Buzzer Module (5V only)</b></li>
        <p>This module is a piezo buzzer that will emit a tone when the data line is driven HIGH, or can be made to play notes and effects by connecting it to a pulse-width modulation (PWM) output.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Buzzer_Module.jpg')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Rotary Angle Sensor Module (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>This Grove module outputs an analog signal between 0V and VCC based on the position of the potentiometer. It has an angular range of 300 degrees.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Rotary_Angle_Sensor_Module.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Sound Sensor (5V only)</b></li>
        <p>This is a sound sensing module with a simple microphone. It can be used to detect the volume of sound in the area. The resistance of the sensor decreases as the level of sound increases.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Sound_Sensor.jpg')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Light Sensor (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>This module detects the intensity of light shining on the sensor. The resistance of the sensor decreases as the amount of illumination increases.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Light_Sensor.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Servo (5V only)</b></li>
        <p>The Grove servo is an actuator that is controlled by a PWM signal. The angle of the servo can be adjusted by changing the pulse width of the input PWM signal.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Servo.jpg')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove Relay (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>The Grove Relay has a normally-open SPST relay that is controlled by a single digital pin. It can be used to control power at much higher voltages that the Sensors mezzanine can handle. When the signal is LOW the relay is open. When it is driven HIGH the relay will close. Use it to control lights and equipment at up to 250V at 10 amps, but be careful when working with mains voltages.</p>

        <li><b>Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor (3.3V/5V)</b></li>
        <p>This Grove module is a high accuracy temperature and humidity sensor.</p>
    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/96boards_images/Grove_Temerature_and_Humidity_Sensor.png')}}" onclick="showImageModal(this)" /><br/>

        <li><b>Grove RGB Backlight LCD (5V only)</b></li>
        <p>This is a great little display module that is easy to control. It is a 16x2 character display with an RGB backlight controller so you can set it to whatever colour you like. This module is controlled using the I2C bus.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the 96Boards Sensors Mezzanine</h2>
<div class="well">
    <p>The 96Boards Sensors Mezzanine board included in this kit is an IO adapter for connecting sensors, actuators and other devices to any 96Boards baseboard. The Sensors mezzanine has exactly the same footprint as a standard size 96Boards Consumer Edition baseboard and fits perfectly on top. Sensors and other devices are connected to the board via 4 pin Grove connectors or via the Arduino compatible shield socket. Additionally, the Sensors mezzanine has a USB to UART adapter for accessing the 96Boards UART console.</p>
