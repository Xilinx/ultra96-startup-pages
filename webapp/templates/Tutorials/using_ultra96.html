        </div>
    
	<h2>Ultra96-V2 Usages</h2>
	<div class="well">
          <p>Below is a list of ways that you can access the Ultra96-V2 Board. These are explained in depth in their own sections below.<p>
	  <ul><br>
	    <li>Webapp</li><br>
	    <li>miniDP</li><br>
	    <li>UART</li><br>
	    <li>SSH</li><br>
	  </ul>
	</div>

        <h2>Webapp</h2>
        <div class="well">
	  <p>This is the simplest of all of the methods. When the board boots for the first time or any other time (into Linux) the webapp will be available by default. Using any device that is able to use Wi-Fi (laptop, tablet, cellphone, etc.) can connect to the webapp by connecting to the board. When the board boots it shows its MAC address <!--(on the first line of the LCD) -->that is appended to the string <strong>Ultra96-V2_</strong> which is what the SSID (network) that can be connected to. <!--On the second line of the LCD is the URL that the user connects to in order to see the webapp-->. If you happen to forget it is <strong>192.168.2.1</strong> and that will bring you to the home page of the webapp.</p>
          <p>The webapp has many uses from running examples to creating your own webpages/projects. Feel free to play around and explore all that the webapp has to offer.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>miniDP</h2>
        <div class="well">
	  <p>It is also possible to see the Linux desktop when you boot the board. <!--This is done by connecting the miniDP to DP cable that is provided in the Ultra96-V2 kit.-->  This is done by connecting a miniDP to DP cable to the Ultra96-V2 kit. Alternatively you can use a miniDP to X adapter where X is some other standard to connect to the monitor, such as HDMI. Once this is done you just simply boot up the board and after a short boot sequence you will see the desktop. From here you can open up the terminal and/or run any other applications as you would in any other Linux environment.</p>
	  <p>The following &quotactive&quot miniDP to HDMI adapters are known to work with the Ultra96-V2 board:</p>
	  <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li><a href="http://ableconn.com/products_2.php?gid=42">Ableconn MDPHD4KAA</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://a.co/d/i5EiEKn">CableCreation CD0095</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://a.co/d/1tFXEvB">Cable Matters 101021</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Note that &quotpassive&quot style adapters will not work.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>UART</h2>
        <div class="well">
	  <p>If you are fine with using just the terminal and have a microUSB to USB cable and an <a href="https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-acc-u96-jtag-3074457345635355958/">Avnet USB UART/JTAG adapter</a> then using this option will work. Connect the microUSB into the port on the USB/JTAG adapter (sold separately) <!-- slot on the mezzanine card (the card on top of the Ultra96-V2) --> and connect the USB into a laptop (or other computer). It is recommended to use either PuTTY or TeraTerm in order to communicate to the board. Both TeraTerm and PuTTY can be downloaded online for free. The explanation provided will assume PuTTY has been chosen (TeraTerm works close enough that it shouldn't be too much hassle to use that instead) and that it is being used on a Windows OS.</p>
	  <p>Once downloaded and everything is connected (and the board is on) open up <strong>Device Manager</strong> in Windows by typing it into the search bar after pressing the Windows Icon. Scroll down to <strong>Ports (COM & LPT)</strong> and find the <strong>USB Serial Port (COM&ltX&gt)</strong> where X is a number. If you have many of them just unplug the USB cable from your device and see what went away and plug it back in. Remember the number X. To find the COM Port in other OS is simple enough and can be found out by searching for the way how online.</p>
	  <p>Open up PuTTY and select <strong>Serial</strong> as the <strong>Connection Type:</strong>. In the space under <strong>Serial line</strong> enter the COM port that you saw before (e.g. <strong>COM5</strong>). Make sure the <strong>Speed</strong> is set to <strong>115200</strong>. Once all of this is ready just press the <strong>Open</strong> button at the bottom of the application and you will get a terminal open. Congratulations, you now have access to the Ultra96-V2 terminal.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>SSH</h2>
        <div class="well">
	  <p>In order to SSH into the board it is once again recommended to use PuTTY or TeraTerm. We will assume for this tutorial that PuTTY is used on a Windows OS. Both programs can be downloaded for free online.</p>
	  <p>Connect to the Ultra96-V2 board via its SSID.  The board&#39s MAC address is appended to the string <strong>&quotUltra96-V2_&quot</strong> (e.g. Ultra96-V2_<strong>AABBCCDDEEFF</strong>) which is the SSID (network) that can be connected to. <!--which can be seen on the first line of the LCD Screen when the board boots (in PetaLinux only). The LCD shows the boards MAC address (on the first line of the LCD) that is appended to the string <strong>Ultra96-V2_</strong> which is the SSID (network) that can be connected to.--> Connect to this network. Next open up PuTTY and under <strong>Connection type:</strong> select <strong>SSH</strong>. Under <strong>Host Name (or IP address)</strong> <!--we will enter the second line of the LCD which is by default--> enter the static IP address for the Ultra96-V2 board (<strong>192.168.2.1</strong>) with the <strong>Port</strong> set to <strong>22</strong>. Click the <strong>Open</strong> button on the bottom of the page and the terminal of the Ultra96-V2 should open appropriately.</p>
